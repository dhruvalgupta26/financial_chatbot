However, long-term investors should carefully consider the potential debt repayment concerns and closely monitor the bank's debt reduction strategy before investing for a longer horizon.\\n\\nRating: 7.5/10\\n\\nTime Frame: 3-6 months to 1 year.\\n\\nRationale:\\n* Expect further appreciation in share price, as investors tend to seek refuge in financial sector during volatile times.\\n* Overall fundamentals appear healthy with minor red flags; not extremely worrisome given strong liquidity in banking.\\n\\nWould consider upgrade of investment duration depending on specific policy change actions being witnessed; nonetheless investment stands secure so long banking systems go into being free markets remain normal to upside (due momentum taking root currently trending down nonetheless poised recency strength)!\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 536, 'prompt_tokens': 1125, 'total_tokens': 1661, 'completion_time': 2.144, 'prompt_time': 0.354551863, 'queue_time': None, 'total_time': 2.4985518630000003}, 'model_name': 'Llama-3.1-70b-Versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9260b4bb2e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-162823ed-5f94-4413-a3db-13296b9801a1-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1125, 'output_tokens': 536, 'total_tokens': 1661})"
